    "In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance. In this project, data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users, will be analysed. "

However, most of the features present a elevated amount of categories, which may become a problem when fiting predictive models. In order to avoid this issue, the features will be simplified by merging together some of the closely related categories. As an example, the feature `diet` contains the categories `strictly vegetarian`, `mostly vegatarian` and `vegetarian`. For the purpose of this project, the three categories can be merged together into just `vegetarian`. "

Subsequently, the categorical variables will be one-hot encoded in order to be able to use them with machine learning models. \n",

Therefore the null values need to be process differently. As most ML models cannot handle nulls in the response variable, the rows with null values in the target variable `body_type` will be removed. The null values in the predictors will be handle in two different ways:\n",
